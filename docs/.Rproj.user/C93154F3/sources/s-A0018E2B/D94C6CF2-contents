### Overview

Adaptive Knockoffs is a procedure for the probelm multiple testing with side information. To learn more about the methodology, readers can read the our paper [Adaptive Knockoffs](). We have a R package, adaptiveKnockoffs, to implement the procedure. This page introduces provides tutorials for using the R package.

### Installation of the R package
To install this package (of the current version), run the following command in your R console:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("zhimeir/adaptiveKnockoffs")
```
----

### Code
All code for the R package is publically available through Github [here](https://github.com/zhimeir/adaptiveKnockoffs). To exactly reproduce the numerical results in the paper, one can use the code in this [repository](https://github.com/zhimeir/adaptiveKnockoffs). Note that since the R package will be constantly updated, it may give slightly different (yet improved) results from those in the paper. Unless the reader intends to reproduce the results in the paper, it is recommended to use the R package.
